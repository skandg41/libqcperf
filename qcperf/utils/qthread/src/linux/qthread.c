/**
 * @file qthread.c
 * @brief Linux implementation of thread management functions
 * @author Skand Gupta (skangupt@qti.qualcomm.com)
 *
 * This file implements the thread management functions defined in qthread.h
 * for Linux platforms. It provides a cross-platform abstraction layer over
 * the POSIX threading APIs, including thread creation, joining, termination,
 * and other thread management operations.
 *
 * The implementation uses POSIX thread functions like pthread_create, pthread_join,
 * and pthread_cancel to provide the functionality required by the qthread interface.
