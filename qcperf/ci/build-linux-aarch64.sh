# QcPerf - Linux ARM64 (LE) cross-compile build script
# ============================================================================
# Wraps the exact command sequence documented in README.md > Compilation
# Instructions > Linux ARM64 > Command Line, parameterized for reuse by the
# PR sanity-build workflow and the tag-triggered release workflow.
#
# Usage:
#   export AARCH64_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/path/to/arm-gnu-toolchain
#   qcperf/ci/build-linux-aarch64.sh <BUILD_TYPE> <BUILD_SHARED> [BACKENDS]
#
#   BUILD_TYPE   - Debug | Release
#   BUILD_SHARED - ON | OFF
#   BACKENDS     - optional, semicolon-separated. Omit to let CMake enable all
#                  backends supported on linux-aarch64 (its default behavior).
#
# Env:
#   AARCH64_TOOLCHAIN_PATH - required, path to ARM GNU Toolchain root
#   PROJECT_VERSION        - optional, default "0.1.0.0" (matches CMake default)
# ============================================================================
