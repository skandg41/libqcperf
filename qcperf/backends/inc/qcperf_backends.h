/**
 * @file qcperf_backends.h
 * @brief Unified backend interface for QcPerf
 * @author Skand Gupta (skangupt@qti.qualcomm.com)
 *
 * This file defines the backend initialization function pointer type and
 * maintains a registry of all available backend initialization functions.
 * It serves as a unified interface between the core library and all backend
 * implementations, allowing the core to remain decoupled from specific backends.
 *
 * Each entry in backend_init_fns[] corresponds to a QcPerfBackendId enum value.
 * Backends that are not compiled in (i.e. their QCPERF_ENABLED_* definition is
 * absent) have a NULL entry. The core checks for NULL before invoking an entry
 * and returns QC_PERF_RETURN_CODE_INVALID_BACKEND_ID for disabled backends.
 *
 * To add a new backend:
 *   1. Add its QCPERF_ENABLED_<NAME> guard and #include below.
 *   2. Add a corresponding NULL / &init_fn entry in backend_init_fns[].
 *   3. Add its name to QCPERF_PLATFORM_SUPPORTED_BACKENDS in cmake/BuildConfig.cmake.
